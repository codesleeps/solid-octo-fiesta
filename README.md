# Description

The Node.js README Generator is a command-line tool that automates the process of creating a professional and well-structured README.md file for your Node.js projects. A README.md file is essential for any open-source project as it provides valuable information about the project, its purpose, installation instructions, usage examples, and other important details.

# Features

 - Interactive CLI: The README generator utilizes an interactive command-line interface (CLI) that prompts you with questions about your project. This enables you to provide the necessary information needed to generate a comprehensive README.md file.
 - Dynamic Template: The generator uses a pre-defined README template combined with the data provided by the user to dynamically generate a README.md file. The template includes sections such as project description, installation instructions, usage examples, API documentation, contribution guidelines, and more.
 - Customizability: The generator allows you to customize various aspects of the README file. You can choose which sections to include or exclude based on your project's requirements. Additionally, you can modify the order of sections to ensure that the README provides a clear and logical flow of information.
 - Markdown Support: The generated README file is formatted using Markdown, a lightweight markup language. Markdown allows you to add headers, lists, code snippets, links, images, and other formatting elements to create a well-structured and visually appealing README.md file.
 - File Overwrite Protection: To prevent accidental data loss, the generator includes a file overwrite protection feature. If a README.md file already exists in the project directory, the generator will prompt you to confirm before overwriting the existing file.
 - Extensibility: The generator is designed to be extensible, allowing you to easily add or modify the template and prompts according to your specific project requirements. This enables you to tailor the generated README.md file to match the unique needs of your project.
